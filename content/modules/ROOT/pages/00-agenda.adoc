== Introduction and Challenge Overview

*Recap of the current security challenges with similar-looking malicious container images.*
*Overview of how these challenges led us to embrace Cosign and Tekton Chains.*

== Deep Dive into Cosign and Sigstore

*Exploration of Cosign as part of the Sigstore project, focusing on its role in securing container images through cryptographic signing.*

== Understanding Tekton Chains in OpenShift Pipelines

*Detailed analysis of how Tekton Chains, as a Kubernetes CRD controller, enhances the supply chain security in our Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines.*
*Discussion on the automatic signing of task runs, the use of advanced attestation formats like in-toto, and the importance of secure storage for artifacts.*

== Advanced Cluster Security (ACS) and Cosign Integration

*Insight into how ACS's integration with Cosign provides additional layers of security and verification for container images in OpenShift.*

== Hands-On Session: Implementing Cosign and Tekton Chains

*Participants will learn to set up Cosign for signing container images and see how Tekton Chains can automate these signatures within OpenShift Pipelines.*

== Challenge Lab

*A practical, scenario-based exercise focusing on applying these concepts in real-world-like simulations, emphasizing problem-solving in image verification and efficient resource provisioning within OpenShift deployments.*
