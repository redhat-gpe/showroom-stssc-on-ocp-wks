== Understanding Tekton Chains in OpenShift Pipelines

=== Enhancing Security with Tekton Chains

Tekton Chains, a Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition (CRD) controller, is crucial in augmenting the supply chain security within our OpenShift Pipelines. This tool's capacity to automatically sign task runs, and its adoption of advanced attestation formats like in-toto, bring a higher degree of trust and verification to our processes. We'll delve into how Tekton Chains ensures that every aspect of our container image production, from creation to deployment, is securely recorded and stored.

=== Installing Tekton Chains for Image Signing

==== Creating the CRD

. Configure Tekton Chains by running the below commands on the terminal:
+
[source, role="execute"]
----
cd
cat <<EOF >> chains.yaml
apiVersion: operator.tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: TektonChain
metadata:
  name: chain
spec:
  artifacts.oci.storage: oci
  artifacts.taskrun.format: in-toto
  artifacts.taskrun.storage: oci
  config: {}
  targetNamespace: openshift-pipelines
  transparency.enabled: true
EOF
oc apply -f chains.yaml
----
+
. Run the next command a few times to check if the deployment is available:
+
[source, role="execute"]
----
oc get deployment tekton-chains-controller -n openshift-pipelines
----
Wait for the *AVAILABLE* column to display *1*
+
[source]
----
NAME                       READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
tekton-chains-controller   1/1     1            1           106m
----

==== Trigger the Pipeline

. Switch back to {codeserver_url}[Code Server,window=_blank]
. On the left side of the screen, under *IDE (WORKSPACE)*, you will find the *globex-ui* source code project.  Expand the *src* folder and click on *index.html*.
+
image::cs-globex-src-index-html.png[]
. On line *19* modify the *center* html element value from *Globex Update* to *Globex Signed*
. From the top menu, click *File > Save*
+
image::cs-globex-src-save-2.png[]
. Click the source control icon on the left side of the screen
. Notice that the *index.html* file is shown under the *Changes* section.  Click the *+* sign to the right of the file name.
This will add the file to the Git staging area.
. Next enter some text in the *Commit* text box, such as *globex update 2*, and click *Commit*.
This saves your changes to the local repository.
. Next click the *Sync Changes* button to push your change to the remote repository.
. Switch back to {openshift_console_url}[Openshift,window=_blank] and click *Pipelines > Pipelines* from the left menu.  Ensure that your project is set to *ci*.
. Notice that another instance of your pipeline run has started.  Wait for it to complete.

==== Examine pipeline
. Click on the pipeline.  The *acs-image-check* is now successful which means that your latest image is now signed with the *Cosign* private key.
. Click on the *TaskRuns* tab and then click on the *TaskRun* of the *build-image* task.
. Scroll down to the *Annotations* section on the *Details* tab and click on the annotations link.  Notice the annotation *chains.tekton.dev/signed* which confirms that Tekton Chains is active and signing your images.
. Navitage back to the latest pipeline run by clicking *Pipelines > Pipelines* from the left menu and selecting the *Last run* pipeline run.
+

. Click on *acs-deploy-check*.  You will see that there is a critical warning that there are no resource requests or limits set for your deployment.  You will be asked to resolve this issue in the challenge section of this workshop.

==== Examine Quay
. Login to {quay_console_url}[Quay,window=_blank] with username *{quay_admin_username}* and password *{quay_admin_password}*.
. Under *REPOSITORIES*, click the repository *quayadmin / globex-ui*
. On the left side of the screen, click on the *Tags* icon.
. Observe that your image tags now have a black shield icon at the end.
. Hover over the icon for a tooltip to appear confirming your tag was signed with Cosign.
