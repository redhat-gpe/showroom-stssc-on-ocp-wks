= Challenge: Resolve Deployment Issues

This part of the workshop is optional and tests your knowledge on resolving Openshift deployment related issues particulary around the risk of over provisioning of resources.

== Updating the globex-ui deployment file

. Using the terminal and the git clone command, clone the project {git_project} with username {git_username} and password {git_password}
. Under the *gitops* root directory, navigate to the *kustomize* base folder of the globex application and identify the *globex-ui* deployment file
. Add requests of *100m cpu* and *200Mi memory*
. Add limits of *200m cpu* and *400Mi memory*
. Commit your changes back to the repository
. Trigger the pipeline as mentioned previously.  Notice that another instance of your pipeline run has started.  Wait for it to complete.

== Examine pipeline
. Click on the pipeline and then click on the *acs-deploy-check* task.
. The critical warning has now been resolved and does not show up in the logs.
